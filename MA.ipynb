    "Brick-and-mortar grocery stores are always in a delicate dance with purchasing and sales forecasting. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leaving money on the table and customers fuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project，which is based on the ongoing kaggle competition, is aim to predict the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores located in Ecuador. If we can build a model that more accurately forecasts product sales, we can better ensure the grocery stores please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time."

There is only one holiday on August which is a special case，the transactions of the day before this holiday is as usual.\n",
