    "# Exploring Periodicity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "After comparing time series plots of various aspects of the data, the total unit sales stuck out as particularly interesting due to what appeared to be a stable periodicity. We judged that if this periodic trend of the total unit sales could be exploited and accurately predicted, then we could just focus on predicting the proportions of sales per store-item pair, effectively standardizing the scale of inputs and expected outputs of any subsequent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here was the motivating plot of total unit sales over the last year, in which you can see a striking consistency in the spacing between spikes. \n",
    "![Total Last Year](periodicity/total_over_last_year.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the metric for this competition is the Root-Mean-Squared-Error of the *log* of predictions and truth, we felt it a natural choice to divide our prediction strategy into separate magnitude and proportion components. In doing so, we recognize the greater penalty for wrong-magnitude predictions over same-magnitude errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there are 54 individual stores and 4100 items, we started with the assumption that no single store-item could greatly influence the total unit sales. We hypothesized it would be easier to determine the magnitude of our predictions from the total unit sales than from store-item specific training because, as the coarsest view of the data, the total unit sales would likely be the least noisy and suffer less from data sparsity. We planned to refine our view of the data successively (i.e. predict per-store unit sales next) if needed to predict magnitudes at a more detailed scale if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the Discrete Fourier Transform of the data we saw that there were three clear peaks but also some incoherent energy at lower frequencies. (The x-axis is labelled in units of \"days per cycle\" instead of the typical units of \"Hz\" to allow for easier interpretation in the context of the problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![DFT of Original Data Over All Years](periodicity/original_fft_all_years.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We suspected the results could be made more coherent if the signal was decomposed by band-pass filters into a filter bank (i.e. hierarchy of frequencies). While wavelets are a typical choice for such purposes, we chose to use a simpler and perhaps more intuitive approach via the Laplacian pyramid transformation, which is a technique borrowed from the image processing community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Laplacian Pyramid\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplacian pyramid is a transformation that allows perfect reconstruction and separates the edges of an image at different scales. It successively convolves an image with a Gaussian kernel (blurring the image) and subtracts the convolved image from the original, leaving predominantly the highest frequencies, since the Gaussian kernel is a low pass filter. As each successive \"level\" of the pyramid is generated by this process, the subtraction is essentially taken between two signals filtered with Gaussian kernels of different scales (standard deviations). The original image is the result of previously performed Gaussian blurs, while the next image is filtered by one additional Gaussian blur. The scales of the Gaussians are effectively different (even though the kernel is unchanged throughout the process) because the signal is successively being downsampled. It so happens that the difference of two Gaussian filters with scale factor ~1.6 closely approximates the \"Laplacian of Gaussians\" filter commonly used in image processing for edge detection, hence the origin of the name \"Laplacian pyramid.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of the Laplacian pyramid performed on an image for demonstration. The results have been scaled to the same size but are actually downsampled by a factor of 2 horizontally and vertically at each stage of the pyramid. The colored image at the end is the highest level of the pyramid (the images are shown in ascending order of pyramid levels). The highest level contains the lowest frequency content.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"periodicity/lpyr_example.png\" title=\"Laplacian Pyramid example on an image\" height=\"300\" width=\"120\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the Laplacian pyramid is simple as it only involves convolution with a Gaussian kernel and downsampling. The reconstruction process is also straightforward. It occurs by blurring and upsampling the highest levels of the pyramid and adding the result to the previous level until all levels have been collapsed back to the original. We were able to implement this transformation in all but 70 lines of Python code using numpy to handle the convolution. (Code can be found in our repository at [pyramid.py](periodicity/pyramid.py).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the result of the DFT on total unit sales separated into different levels of the Laplacian pyramid. The lowest levels of the pyramid intuitively should contain more of the higher component frequencies of the signal. (The y-axis of these plots is in transformed units, not the original total unit sales. We removed the linear and loglinear trends of the data to provide better conditions for the DFT.)\n",

Here is the same information but in a stacked plot to show the coefficients of different levels in the same y-axis scale.\n",

    "![DFT of Laplacian Pyramid Transformed Data Over All Years](periodicity/lpyr_fft_all_years.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can hardly see the influence of higher pyramid levels and we notice the incoherency at lower frequencies is gone in this stacked view. This tells us the highest frequency \"edges\" of our signal (the spikes) indeed happen at 2.3, 3.5, and 7 day cycles. Indeed we can see this periodicity manifest well in a plot of the last 60 days of the data, plotted with pyramid levels separated.\n",

    "All the models above can handle the time feature well, but cannot insert all those categorical features. In order to do that, we come to machine learning method for help. When applying those method, feature engineering and computation speed becomes extremely important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. First Try\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling time series in traditional mathine learning method is rather tricky. We first dummy the date into year, month, the number of the week as well as weekday, and feed all the unit sale data into the models from 20160801 to 20170815. Besides, we dummy all the categorical features such as the state, city, store type and cluster and use them as new features. The model we've tired in this part including Random Forest, Bagging, XGBoost as well as MLP. The plot below descirbes the feature performance.\n",

    "![performance](https://favorita-ee379k.github.io/MLgraph/performance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the picture, we can see that XGBoost is still the best among the four machine learning models but they all get a score of more than 1, twice as large as the Moving Average's score and even larger than the last year model. The poor performance is because of the feature enginnering we made was not good. The date itself does not contain enough information, and feeding all the raw time series data will lead to overfitting. Besides, these four models need a huge amount of time to tune and train given the amount of training data. We need to find a faster model first before further feature Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LGBM is faster\n",
    "\n",
    "LGBM is short for Light Gradient Boosting Method. Different from other boosing methods, this model splits the trees leaf-wise instead of level-wise, this allows LGBM to minimise loss faster and thus gain more computation speed. The pictures below describes the concept well.\n",
    "\n",
    "![leaf-wise](https://favorita-ee379k.github.io/MLgraph/leaf-wise.png)\n",
    "![level-wise](https://favorita-ee379k.github.io/MLgraph/level-wise.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of LGBM, we get more time and more patience to do more feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "With the inspiration of moving average and smoothing method, we begin to view time series as a combination of trend, seasonality and noise. We want to capture the trend and seasonality instead of noise. First, for the trend, we calculate the average unit sales of each item in a certain store. The time period we used was firstly 7 days, 14 days, 28 days as well as 56 days, since this will capture the weekly mean as well as monthly trend. But after we did a FFT on the data we also discovered a period of 2 days and 3 days, so we add the 2-day mean and 3-day mean into our model too. We use these moving-average features to predict the following 16 days since the task is to predict the last 16 days' sale in August. In that way we capture the trend well. Next, to capture the seasonality, the 16 days of training data all begins on Wednesday, the same with the first day of the test set. We fit 16 LGBM model individually to the 16 days in our prepared training dataset. In this way we capture the short term seasonality well. However, in this way, our model only used the most information of 16 days and a small amount of information of 56 days. The way we use information is still insufficient. In order to cope with that, we created 4 training sets, begining at 6.28, 7.5, 7.12 and 7.19. For the yearly trend, we just ignored it, for we tried the same thing on 2016 and 2017 but after ensemble them the result got worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "For transaction features, we used 7 day mean, 14 day mean and 28 day mean. For categorical features, we used store city and store cluster as well as onpromotion and amount of ompromotion in last 14 days. We also tried other features like oil price but it was total useless and ruined our result. The structure of feature engineering are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![feature_structure](https://favorita-ee379k.github.io/MLgraph/feature_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature importances of the first day and the last day in the training set are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![day_1](https://favorita-ee379k.github.io/MLgraph/day_1.png)\n",
    "![day_2](https://favorita-ee379k.github.io/MLgraph/day_16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table allows to view the order change of the 16 days more clearly.\n",
    "![feature_importance](https://favorita-ee379k.github.io/MLgraph/feature_importance.png)\n",
    "We can find that as the number of days goes up, 7 day mean's importance decreases while 56 day mean's importance increases. This indicating that as when the predicting date is far away from our training data, the importance of long term trend goes up while the importance of short term trend goes down.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this model, we reached a score of 0.520. After ensembled it with the result from moving average, we reached a score of 0.517, ranking 38/1126 in the competition.\n",
